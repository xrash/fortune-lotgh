# Legend of the Galactic Heroes quotes

If you have ever watched this series, you know it is not a common show.

LOTGH is a remarkable joint of great political plot, strategic space battles and dozens of characters with thick pasts. As it is extremely well written and the story features several intelligent characters, there are lots of great quotes showing up in every episode.

As a fan of the good and old __fortune__ program, I have decided to put together some of those quotes and release it.

For now, I got only english quotes, but soon there will be a portuguese version. Because portuguese just sound better when seriously speaking (and LOTGH is serious stuff, you know).
