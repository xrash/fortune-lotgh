Annerose saw a soft and gentile light inside Reinhard's look that she has 
never seen before. This convinced Annerose of his brother's death.

Was Reinhard transforming his flesh into light only to satisfy 
his empty heart? Reinhard's kindness was like the heat of the white ashes
 that came from this heart and body incinerated.

I never liked Oberstein as a person. But reconsidering, I probably followed 
him more than anyone else. That is because his arguments are solid enough 
not give room to discuss.

Mittenmeyer, do you remember of what happened five years ago? When I was 
living at Linbergstrause with Kircheis, there was a moment where you and 
Reuenthal came to visit us, remember? Among the four who chat on that 
room at that day, you and me are the only alive.

Do not die. It's an order.

For, if you give me the rights to speak with conviction, democracy is the 
philosophy of making friends an equal, not of making servitude relationships. 
I want to have good friends, and I want to be friends with other. 
But I do not want to be a good master neither a good servant. 

A toast to democracy.

I just studied a bit of history. But I learned that there are two chains of 
reasoning in human society. One says that there are lots of things more 
valuable than human life, and other says that nothing is more valuable than 
human life. When people want to fight, they use the excuse of supporting 
the first one. When they they want to stop, they justify with the second. 
For how many decades... how many centuries this will continue?

Please, Kaiser, don't give me a chance for a rebellion. I chose you to be 
the leader of the history, I supported you and looked proudly to your streamer. 
Please, don't make me regret it. You must always walk before me with 
a brilliant ambition. Passivity and stability cannot be the source of your light. 
Incomparable ambition and agressivity are your virtues.

Genes determine everything? What nonsense. Hereditary physical qualities have 
no effect on people? That's for individuals. Heredity concerns family background, 
not personal abilities. Those who blindly believe in such a theory are normally 
guys who are happy with their present conditions. They're the real weaklings. 
Those who are proud of their ancestors are fellows who've done nothing to be 
proud of themselves. These are the people I despise most. I look down on them.

Indeed, a small act of opposition is unable to solve any problem. The society 
needs a complete revolution. Such unreasonable occurances must be entirely corrected. 
And we must not wait for others to correct them. We must carry out the

No matter which period, or which society, people always gaze at the stars when they are 
young. Then they stretch out their hands and try to catch them. And then one day they 
realize their arms are not long enough to catch the stars, and that's when they think 
they've grown up. But I don't agree. I must catch all the stars.
