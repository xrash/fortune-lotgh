Annerose saw a soft and gentile light inside Reinhard's look that she has 
never seen before. This convinced Annerose of his brother's death.

 that came from this heart and body incinerated.

I just studied a bit of history. But I learned that there are two chains of 
reasoning in human society. One says that there are lots of things more 
valuable than human life, and other says that nothing is more valuable than 
human life. When people want to fight, they use the excuse of supporting 
the first one. When they they want to stop, they justify with the second. 
For how many decades... how many centuries this will continue?

Genes determine everything? What nonsense. Hereditary physical qualities have 
no effect on people? That's for individuals. Heredity concerns family background,

proud of themselves. These are the people I despise most. I look down on them.

An army is a tool for violence, and there are two kinds of violence... 
Violence to control and oppress, and violence as a means of liberation. 
You know, what we call a national army, is fundamentally the former example. 
It's a pity, but history doesn't lie. When those in power confront popular 
opposition, there aren't many examples of the army siding with the people. 
Far from it. In the past, in country after country, the army itself evolved 
into a power structure, and came to control the people with violence.

In the 9th year of the Imperial Century, the great Kaiser Rudolf 
invented a way to eliminate weak genes and created policies to eliminate 
the weak from society. Mankind is always supported and advanced 
by the elite and a society that supports the weak leads to the 
deterioration of mankind.

The great Kaiser especially focused on genetics in order to bring a 
bright future to mankind. People with genetic abnormalities were 
forcibly sterilized and people are now becoming free of genetic diseases 
and abnormalities. Also, potential and willingness to work have been 
found to be passed on by genes. Because of this, today's policies have 
been formed: People with strong genes were given noble status 
and people with weak genes became slaves.
